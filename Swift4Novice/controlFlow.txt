                    CONTROL FLOW :-
1.For-in loop -
To perform a task several times , we use the ‘for-in loop’ to iterate over a sequence, such as an array, range of numbers or characters in the string.
eg...
var items = [1,2,3,4,5]
for item in items {
print(item)
}
The output would be as follows −
1
2
3
4
5

2.While loop -
The While Loop is used to perform a task multiple times. It is used when we need to iterate over a condition until it becomes false.
while (condition) {
Statements; }
eg..
var i = 5
while (i > 0) {
print(i)
i = i - 1;
}
}
Output −
5
4
3
2
1
Repeat-while loop
This is another version of while loop. In this loop, the control passes through the statement at least once before checking the condition. The syntax of the repeat-while loop is as follows −
repeat  {
statements
}
while(condition)
eg...
var i=5
repeat {
print(i)
i = i - 1;
}
while (i>0)
The output would be as follows −
5
4
3
2
1
