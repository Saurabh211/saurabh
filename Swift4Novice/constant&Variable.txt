                    Constants and Variables :-
Constants and variables associate a name  with a value of a particular type (such as the number 11 or the string "XYZ"). The value of a constant can not be changed when it is set, whereas a variable can be set to a different value.

                    Declaring Constants and Variables :-
Constants and variables must be declared before their use.  Constants are declare with the let keyword and variables with the var keyword. Here is an example of how constants and variables can be used to track the number of login attempts a user has made:
let maximumMarksObtained = 1000
var student1_Obtained = 800
This code can be read as:
“Declare a new constant called maximumMarksObtained, and give it a value of 1000. Then, declare a new variable called student1_Obtained, and gives value of 800.”

                Printing Constants and Variables :-
You can print the current value of a constant or variable with the print(_:separator:terminator:) function.
The print(_:separator:terminator:) function is a global function that prints one or more values to an appropriate output , for example, the print(_:separator:terminator:) function prints its output in Xcode’s “console” pane.
