                      SWIFT : BASIC
Swift is a  programming language for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS app development. Swift is quite similar to C and Objective-C
Swift provides all fundamental C and Objective-C types its own versions of,including Double and Float for floating-point & Int for integers values,
 Bool for Boolean values, and String for textual data. Swift provides three primary collection types, Array, Set, and Dictionary, which is described in Collection Types.
 Swift uses variables to store and refer to values by an identifying name and also makes extensive use of variables whose values can not be changed which are known as constants, and are much stornger than constants in C. Constants are used in Swift to make code safer and clearer , when you work with values that don’t need to change.
In addition to similar types, Swift introduces advanced Types which are not found in Objective-C, such as "tuples". Tuples enable you to create and pass around groupings of values. You can use a tuple to return multiple values from a function as a single compound value.
Swift also contain optional types, which handle the absence of a value. Optionals say wheather “there is a value, and it equals x” or “there isn’t a value at all”. Using optionals is like to use nil with pointers in Objective-C, but they work for any type, not just classes.Optionals are not only safer and more expressive than nil pointers in Objective-C, they are at the heart of many of Swift’s most stronger features.
Swift is a type-safe language, which means the language helps you to be clear about the types of values your code can work with. If part of your code requires a String, type safety prevents you from passing it an Int by mistake.  Type safety prevents you from accidentally passing an optional String to a piece of code that requires a non-optional String. Type safety helps you to catch and fix errors as soon as possible in the development process.
