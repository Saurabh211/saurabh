                        Basic Operators
An operator is a special symbol that you use to combine , check or change values. For example, the addition operator- "+" adds two numbers, such as let i = 1 + 2, and the logical AND operator-"&&" combines two Boolean values, such as if(enteredDoorCode && passedRetinaScan).

 The assignment operator "=" does not return a value. To prevent it from being mistakenly used when the equal to operator "==" is intended.

Arithmetic operators  +, -, *, /, % and many others detect value overflow, to avoid unexpected results when working with numbers that become larger or smaller than the allowed value range of the type that stores them.

You can opt in to value overflow behavior by using Swiftâ€™s overflow operators, as described in Overflow Operators.
Swift also provides range operators that are not found in C, e.g. a..<b and a...b, as a shortcut for expressing a range of values.
