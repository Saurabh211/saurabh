                    Enumeration:-
An enumeration is a user-defined data type which consists of set of related values. For enumerated data type enum keyword is used.
It is declared in a class and its values are accessed through the instance of that class.
Initial member value is defined using enum intializers.
Its functionality is also extended by ensuring standard protocol functionality.

                    Syntax:-
enum enumname {
// enumeration values are described here
}
enum DaysofaWeek {
case Sunday
case Monday
---
case Saturday
}
var lang = names.Closures
lang = .Closures
switch lang {
case .Swift:
print("Welcome to Swift")
case .Closures:
print("Welcome to Closures")
default:
print("Introduction")
}
When we run the above program using playground, we get the following result âˆ’
Welcome to Closures
